When a JSON extension is installed such as quarkus-resteasy-reactive-jackson or quarkus-resteasy-reactive-jsonb, 
Quarkus will use the application/json media type by default for most return values, 
unless the media type is explicitly set via @Produces or @Consumes annotations 
(there are some exceptions for well known types, such as String and File, 
which default to text/plain and application/octet-stream respectively).

    @Path("{id}")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    @GET
    public Timer findTimer(String id)
